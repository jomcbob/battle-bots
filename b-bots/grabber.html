    <p></p><!-- the <p></p> is there to add a line so that it looks better. -->
The Grabber is designed to grab other battle-bots drive axle with its claw and drive the helpless battle bot out of the ring.
<p>As you can probably see from the pictures above it does have some weaknesses such as being fliped so it can't move, and also</p> 
<p>Being driven under so that its back weels can't touch the ground. Of these the issue of being fliped over I believe can be fixed,</p>
<p>By adding a extension on the arm of the claw so that when I lift the claw up when upside down it will turn me right side up.</p>
